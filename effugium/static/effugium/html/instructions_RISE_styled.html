            Welcome to Roomworld! <br>
            <br>
            Here, you will play 92 short rounds that will take you 45 to 60 minutes to complete in total. Each round is a set of rooms on a different floor.<br>
            <br>
            You are challenged to move through the rooms to get to the gift. Every fifth round will be a Challenge Round, slightly more difficult than the ones before.
            <br>
            To navigate through each round, click the arrow keys &#10145; &#11015; 	&#11014; &#11013; on your keyboard. <br>
            <br>
            If you're unsure how to solve a round, you have two options: <br>
            <br>
            You can try to solve the round again. To do this, click <b>restart round</b>. This will restart the same round. You can do this up to three times on a regular round, but can't do it on a Challenge Round. <br>
            <br>
            You can also give up and skip to the next round. To do this, click <b>skip round</b>. This will take you to the next round. <br>
            <br>
            You can only complete Roomworld once, so make sure to give it your full attention. Closing the browser and relaunching the game will resume your progress.<br>
            <br>
            Find a quiet place with a good internet connection and turn off your notifications.<br>
            <br> 
            If you find in the first couple of rounds that your connection isn't good enough, you can stop playing and come back later. <br>
            <br>
            Remember: this game is just one part of the Rise Challenge.<br>
            All of the tasks you've completed count together to form a whole picture of you as an applicant throughout the Rise Challenge, so don't worry if you don't solve a round.<br>
